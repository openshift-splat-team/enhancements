# Route Secret Injection For External Certificate Management

## Summary

Currently, users of OpenShift cannot very easily integrate OpenShift Routes
with third-party certificate management solutions like [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager).
And this is mainly due to the design of Routes API which deliberately requires the certificate
data to be present in the Route object as opposed to having a reference. This is especially
problematic when third-party solutions also manage the life cycle (create/renew/delete)
of the generated certificates which OpenShift Routes does not support and requires
manual intervention to manage certificate life cycle.

This enhancement aims to provide a solution where OpenShift Routes can support
integration with third-party certificate management solutions like cert-manager and
avoid manual certificate management by the user which is more error prone.

## Motivation

OpenShift customers currently manually manage certificates for user workloads
by updating OpenShift Routes with the updated certificate data during expiry/renew
workflow. This is cumbersome activity if users have a huge number of workloads and
is also error prone.

This enhancement adds the support to OpenShift Routes for third-party certificate
management solutions like cert-manager by extending the Route API to read the serving
certificate data via a secret reference.

### User Stories

- As an end user of Route API, I want to be able to provide a tls secret reference on
  OpenShift Routes so that I can integrate with third-party certificate management solution.

- As an OpenShift cluster administrator, I want to use third-party solutions like cert-manager
  for certificate management of user workloads on OpenShift so that no manual process is
  required to renew expired certificates.

- As an OpenShift engineer, I want to update the router so that it is able read
  secrets directly if all the preconditions have been met by the router serviceaccount.

  - The router serviceaccount must have permission to read this particular secret.
  - The role and rolebinding to provide this access must be provided by the user.

- As an OpenShift engineer, I want to update the route validation in openshift/library-go
  in order to validate the updated Route API.

  - Both OpenShift and Microshift run the openshift/library-go validations as part of admission plugin.

- As an OpenShift engineer, I want to be able to update Route API so that I can integrate
  OpenShift Routes with third-party certificate management solutions like cert-manager.

- As an OpenShift engineer, I want to be able to run e2e tests as part of openshift/origin
  so that testcases are executed to signal feature health by CI executions.

### Goals

- Provide users with a configurable option in Route API to reference externally managed certificates via secrets.
- Provide smooth roll out of new certificates on OpenShift router when referenced certificates
  are renewed (secret containing the certificate is updated).

### Non-Goals

- Provide certificate life cycle management controls on the Route API (expiryAfter, renewBefore, etc).
- Modify ingress-to-route controller behaviour to use the external managed certificate reference from Route API.
- Extend this feature to cover CA certificate or destination CA certificate in the Route API.

## Proposal

This enhancement proposes extending the openshift/router to read serving certificate data either
from the Route `.spec.tls.certificate` and `.spec.tls.key` or from a new field `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`
which is a `kubernetes.io/tls` type secret reference. This `externalCertificate` field will enable the
users to provide a reference to a secret containing the serving cert/key pair that will be parsed
and served by OpenShift router.

### Workflow Description

The following workflow describes the integration with third party
certificate management solutions like cert-manager with the certificate
reference field described under [API Extensions](#api-extensions).

- The end user must have generated the serving certificate
  as a prerequisite using third-party systems like cert-manager.
- In cert-manager's case, the [Certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources)
  CR must be created in the same namespace where the Route is going to be created.
- The end user must create a role in the same namespace as the secret containing
  the certificate which was generated by the cert-manager from earlier.
  ```bash
  oc create role secret-reader --verb=get,list,watch --resource=secrets --resource-name=<secret-name>
  ```
- The end user must create a rolebinding in the same namespace as the secret
  and bind the router serviceaccount to the above created role.
  ```bash
  oc create rolebinding foo-secret-reader --role=secret-reader --serviceaccount=openshift-ingress:router --namespace=<current-namespace>
  ```
- To expose a user workload, the user would create a new Route with the
  `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` referencing the generated secret that was created
  in the previous step.
- If the secret that is referenced exists and has a successfully generated
  cert/key pair, the router will serve this certificate if all preconditions (listed [below](#implementation-detailsnotesconstraints-optional)) are met.

#### Variation [optional]

N.A

### API Extensions

A `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field is added to Route `.spec.tls` which can be used to provide a secret name
containing the certificate data instead of using `.spec.tls.certificate` and `spec.tls.key`.

```go

// TLSConfig defines config used to secure a route and provide termination
//
// +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="has(self.termination) && has(self.insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy) ? !((self.termination=='passthrough') && (self.insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy=='Allow')) : true", message="cannot have both spec.tls.termination: passthrough and spec.tls.insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Allow"
// +openshift:validation:FeatureSetAwareXValidation:featureSet=TechPreviewNoUpgrade;CustomNoUpgrade,rule="!(has(self.certificate) && has(self.externalCertificate))", message="cannot have both spec.tls.certificate and spec.tls.externalCertificate"
type TLSConfig struct {
	// ...

	// externalCertificate provides certificate contents as a secret reference.
	// This should be a single serving certificate, not a certificate
	// chain. Do not include a CA certificate. The secret referenced should
	// be present in the same namespace as that of the Route.
	// Forbidden when `certificate` is set.
	//
	// +openshift:enable:FeatureSets=CustomNoUpgrade;TechPreviewNoUpgrade
	// +optional
	ExternalCertificate *LocalObjectReference `json:"externalCertificate,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=externalCertificate"`
}

// LocalObjectReference contains enough information to let you locate the
// referenced object inside the same namespace.
// +structType=atomic
type LocalObjectReference struct {
	// name of the referent.
	// More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
	// +optional
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=name"`
}
```

_Note_: The default value would be `nil`, both `nil` and empty `LocalObjectReference{}`
are treated as though the field is unset. The secret is required to be created in the
same namespace as that of the Route. The secret must be of type `kubernetes.io/tls` and
the tls.key and the tls.crt key must be provided in the `data` (or `stringData`) field
of the Secret configuration.

If neither `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` or `.spec.tls.certificate` and `.spec.tls.key` are
provided the router will serve the default generated certificates. User's will not be able to
provide both `.spec.tls.certificate/key` and `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`. API server
admission validation will enforce this.

All valid and invalid scenarios will be depicted via the existing `RouteIngressCondition`.

#### Variation

N.A

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

The router will read the secret referenced in `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` and will use
the certificate inside to configure HAProxy if the secret is present and if the
following pre-conditions are met:


- Validations done by API server as part of [AllocateHost()](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-apiserver/blob/bd2a35e58172010c658f4d8f4dff8f9f0eac187d/pkg/route/apiserver/registry/route/strategy.go#L75)

  -  Any user that is creating a route which has a non-empty `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`, will need  `create` permission on the `routes/custom-host` sub-resource.
     -  [certSet](https://github.com/openshift/library-go/blob/f03310f6a5328b76d1a268695120cdf5326dfdb3/pkg/route/hostassignment/assignment.go#L34) will be `true` if `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` is specified.
     -  This pre-check aligns with existing implementation of `.spec.tls.certificate` field.

- Validations done by API server as part of [ValidateRoute()](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-apiserver/blob/aac3dd5bf0547e928103a0f718ca104b1bb13930/pkg/route/apis/route/validation/validation.go#L21)

  - The router serviceaccount must have permission to get/list/watch this secret.
    - The role and rolebinding to provide this access must be provided by the user.
  - The secret should be in the same namespace as that of the route.
  - The secret should be of type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
  - CEL validations and openshfit/library-go will enforce that both `.spec.tls.certificate` and `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`
    are not specified on the route at the same time. Since CEL validations are not run on OpenShift API server, the same
    validation will be done as part of `ValidateRoute()`.


- Validations done by API server as part of [ValidateHostUpdate()](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-apiserver/blob/bd2a35e58172010c658f4d8f4dff8f9f0eac187d/pkg/route/apiserver/registry/route/strategy.go#L96)

  - If the new route uses `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`,  this validation will always
    have the precondition [certificateChangeRequiresAuth()](https://github.com/openshift/library-go/blob/d8d3f3f8a9e4a82c110a89a13229ce1412a88e4a/pkg/route/hostassignment/assignment.go#L123C29-L123C29) return `true`, 
    as we cannot definitively verify if the content of the referenced secret has been modified.
    Even if the secret name remains unchanged, we must assume that the secret content (certificate info) is changed, necessitating authorization.
  - Updating TLS certificate is contingent on the user having either `create` or `update` permission on the `routes/custom-host` sub-resource. 
  Removal of the TLS certificate is allowed without these permissions check. This statement aligns with the existing validation of the `.spec.tls.certificate` field and is also mentioned in [openshift/origin#18177 add update verb to routes/custom-host for admin role](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/18177#issuecomment-360660024).
  - Refer to [Permission requirements on routes/custom-host](#permission-requirements-on-routescustom-host) and [Drawbacks](#exception-in-validations-between-api-server-and-the-router) for additional details.


- Validations done by the router as part of [ExtendedValidateRoute()](https://github.com/openshift/router/blob/c407ebbc5d8d85daea2ef2d1ba539444a06f4d25/pkg/router/routeapihelpers/validation.go#L158) (contents of secret),

  - The secret created should be in the same namespace as that of the route.
  - The secret created is of type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
  - Verify certificate and key (PEM encode/decode)
  - Verify private key matches public certificate

The router being an edge component, from a security standpoint is more prone to
being compromised. In order to avoid providing the router with escalated privileges
to read all secrets, the router will implement a single item list/watch for secrets (secret monitor).
This uses name-scoped rbac (created by the user) to access the particular secrets.

A watch based secret monitor will be introduced in the router in order to keep
track of all the secrets referenced by the routes. This component is solely
responsible for maintaining all the single item list-watch functions required
to cache the referenced secrets.

The router will bootstrap the secret monitor to ensure it can keep the
certificate up-to-date. This means the router pod will maintain active watches
for every secret that is referenced by a route.

Every active watch will be linked to a route, meaning the secret monitor
will be linked to the lifecycle of the route. For every new route that is created,
the secret monitor will start a sharedinformer if the route uses `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`.
If a route is deleted, the secret monitor will stop the sharedinformer associated
with the route.

The [createServiceAliasConfig()](https://github.com/openshift/router/blob/6117b7ba414c7073274e2d19c43082031393ccd7/pkg/router/template/router.go#L927) creation logic will be updated in the router to also parse
the secret referenced in `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`. The router will
use the default certificates only when `.spec.tls.certificate/key` or `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`
are not provided.

The cluster-ingress-operator will propagate the relevant Tech-Preview feature gate down to the
router. This feature gate will be added as a command-line argument called `ROUTER_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_CERTIFICATE`
to the router and will not be user configurable.

### Risks and Mitigations

There is a possibility of an invalid route being processed by the router (edge case),
if any changes are done to the rbac or the referenced secret is deleted after the API
server validation but before router has processed the route (maybe router pod is not running)
then this can lead to the router processing this incorrect route.

> Will need to duplicate the following rbac validations present on the API server to
> the router as part of `ExtendedValidateRoute()`.
>
> - The router serviceaccount must have permission to get/list/watch this secret.
>   - The role and rolebinding to provide this access must be provided by the user.

### Drawbacks

The user will need to manually create, provide and maintain the rbac required by the
router so that it can access secrets. This becomes tedious when users have
many routes.

The workaround for this is to document various levels of rbac that can be provided,

- Grant router service account access to secret by secret-name (explicit rbac)
- Grant router service account access to all secrets in a fixed namespace (implicit rbac)

The above variations need to be documented for the end user as part of OpenShift documentation.

#### Exception in Validations between API server and the router

The `routes/custom-host` permission check is intentionally done only on the API server
and not the router as well, this will result in not having this validation for events that
are generated by the secret monitor directly to the route controller in the router. So if
a user who has necessary permissions on `custom-host` creates a route
that sets `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` the validation on the API server will pass and
the route is successfully created. Post creation of the route if the permissions for `custom-host`
are revoked and the user edits the contents of the secret, the router would still be
able successfully reload the certificate on the route, which means the user without having 
permission on `custom-host` could update the secret for the external certificate later on.

## Design Details

### Open Questions [optional]

- Performance testing of openshift-router in tech-preview? Is there
  a workflow present where we can gather some early metrics (memory, cpu)? This will help in
  preemptively addressing performance concerns before going GA.

  > Will be addressed when taking feature from TP -> GA.

- Do we make changes to the ingress-to-route controller as well?

  > The ingress-to-route behaviour will remain as is i.e. it will not make use of
  > the newly introduced field.

### Permission requirements on `routes/custom-host`
- `create` is required to set `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` on route creation. 
  [AllocateHost()](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-apiserver/blob/bd2a35e58172010c658f4d8f4dff8f9f0eac187d/pkg/route/apiserver/registry/route/strategy.go#L75) enforces this check.
- Either `create` or `update` is required on route update with non-empty `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`. 
  [ValidateHostUpdate](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-apiserver/blob/bd2a35e58172010c658f4d8f4dff8f9f0eac187d/pkg/route/apiserver/registry/route/strategy.go#L96) enforces this check.

  - Few examples:

    - Adding `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` to a route when no certificate was present.

    - Adding `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` to a route when TLS configuration was nil.

    - Switching from `.spec.tls.certificate/key` to `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`.

    - Changing the secret name referenced by `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`.
  
    - **Even keeping the secret name unchanged, requires permission check. Since the state of the external secret cannot be verified.**
      - **_NOTE_** :  This restriction potentially blocks all updates to a route that specifies `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` if the user does not have the "custom-host" permission. Even updating an unrelated field or adding an annotation will be blocked.

- No permission is required to remove `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` from route.

  - Few examples:

    - Removing externalCertificate and setting the route to use no certificate.

    - Removing externalCertificate and setting the route to use a nil TLS configuration.

- Namespace level admin and editor by default get `create` through [bootstrappolicy](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-apiserver/blob/6b5184128103eaad64d7b00f0d1de9b7c3597112/pkg/bootstrappolicy/policy.go#L343-L388). 
  Only `cluster-admin` gets `update` by default.

- Refer following links for `routes/custom-host` permission history:
  - https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/13905
  - https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/18177#issuecomment-360660024
  - https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/18312



### Test Plan

Update router tests in openshift/origin and supplement all existing certificate related tests
with new tests utilizing `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`. Ensure the tests cover the following scenarios,

- Updating routes from default certificates to certificate referenced via
  secrets and vice-versa.
- Updating secret/certificate referenced in routes and verify serving
  certificate has been updated.
- Updating secret/certificate with incorrect information and verify route
  is not admitted due to validation failure. (eg: mismatched public and private key, etc)

### Graduation Criteria

This feature will initially be released as Tech Preview only. The e2e tests
in openshift/origin will only be added when graduating this feature to GA.

#### Dev Preview -> Tech Preview

N/A. This feature will go directly to Tech Preview.

#### Tech Preview -> GA (Future work)

The e2e tests as part of openshift/origin should be consistently passing.
The router will need to undergo performance testing as part of OCP payload
to ensure the memory implications of creating and maintains all the active watches
is verified to be efficient.

Update API godoc to document that manual intervention is required for using
`.spec.tls.externalCertificate`. Something simple like: "The Router service account
needs to be granted with read-only access to this secret, please refer to openshift docs
for additional details."

Update implementation details to cover internal working of secret monitor.

##### Future work

The ingress-to-route controller in the route-controller-manager will need to
be updated to ensure that the created routes use `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`
instead of `.spec.tls.certificate`. Additional tests will need to be added into
o/origin for this scenario.

Current implementation does not use `caCert` in the secret to populate
`.spec.tls.caCertificate`, this can be added in the future.

#### Removing a deprecated feature

N/A.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

On downgrades, all routes specifying `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` will switch over to use the default certificates
unless the route is manually edited and the `.spec.tls` is updated.

Upgrade strategy not considered since this feature is going to be added as TechPreviewNoUpgrade.

### Version Skew Strategy

This feature will be added as TechPreviewNoUprade.

### Operational Aspects of API Extensions

Route validation in the API server and router will be modified to validate the following scenarios,

- Check if secret/certificate referenced under `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` exists.
- Check if secret/certificate referenced under `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` is of the correct type.
- Check if router service account has permissions to read referenced secret.
- Check if route has only one of the fields set,
  - `.spec.tls.certificate` and `.spec.tls.key`
  - `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`

#### Failure Modes

##### Referenced secret not present

As part of `ExtendedValidateRoute()`, the router will validate if the secret
referenced in the router exists. If a route fails this validation, it is not
processed further and the error will be reflected on the route `.status`
with the same reason.

##### Insufficient router permission

As part of the API server validation, if the router does not have permission
to read the secret referenced under `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`, the route is
rejected with an `FieldValueForbidden` error and reason as `insufficient permission
to read resource`.

##### Incorrect secret type

As part of `ExtendedValidateRoute()`, the router validates the content of the secret
that is referenced under `.spec.tls.externalCertificate`. Failure will result in the route
not being admitted and this will reflect under route `.status` as `FieldValueInvalid`.

#### Support Procedures

N.A

## Implementation History

## Alternatives

### Secret Injector

An alternative proposal is to introduce a new controller (secret-injector) in [route-controller-manager](https://github.com/openshift/route-controller-manager)
to manage a new annotation (secret-reference) on the Route object. This annotation
enables the users to provide a reference to a Secret containing the serving cert/key
pair that will be injected to `.spec.tls` and will be served by OpenShift router.
This annotation will be given a higher preference if route CR also has `.spec.tls.certificate`
and `.spec.tls.key` fields set.

> This approach was dropped after much deliberation as it introduces a confused deputy problem
> as well as opens a security flaw where a user could read the contents of an arbitrary secret.

### Extend oc CLI

As an alternative to requiring the user create the role and rolebinding to grant the router
access to the secrets, this behaviour can be baked into `oc create route`. This will reduce
the number of manual steps and will be less error prone. But here's the catch, how widely
is `oc create route` used and do users who manage 100s of routes really use it.
