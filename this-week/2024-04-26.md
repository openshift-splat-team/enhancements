- [1267](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1267): (5/287) network: vSphere IPI Support for Static IPs (rvanderp3) ([OCPPLAN-9654](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPPLAN-9654))

  > Static IP addresses are emerging as a common requirement in environments where
  > the usage of DHCP violates corporate security guidelines.  Additionally, many
  > users which require static IPs also require the use of the IPI installer.
  > The proposal described in this enhancement discusses the implementation of
  > assigning static IPs at both day 0 and day 2.

- [1611](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1611): (7/7) observability: Init observability directory for cross-team proposals (periklis)

  > Recently we see a couple of proposal addressing enhancements tangential to more than one observability product and/or team, i.e.:
  > - #1524
  > - #1566
  > - #1494
  >
  > This PR adds a new directory to collect and review the above and future enhancements in the observability program. The `OWNERS` file is an aggregation of all approvers found in other observability related subdirectories.

  `do-not-merge/work-in-progress`

  > Multi-Cluster Observability has been an integrated concept in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) since its inception but only incorporates one of the core signals, namely metrics, to manage fleets of OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) based clusters (See [RHACM Multi-Cluster-Observability-Operator (MCO)](rhacm-multi-cluster-observability)). The underlying architecture of RHACM
  > observability consists of a set of observability components to collect a dedicated set of OCP metrics, visualizing them and alerting on fleet-relevant events. It is an optional but closed circuit system applied to RHACM managed fleets without any points of extensibility.
  >
  > This enhancement proposal seeks to bring a unified approach to collect and forward logs and traces from a fleet of OCP clusters based on the RHACM addon facility (See Open Cluster Management (OCM) [addon framework](ocm-addon-framework)) by enabling these signals events to land on third-party managed and centralized storage solutions (e.g. AWS Cloudwatch, Google Cloud Logging). The
  > multicluster-observability-addon is an optional RHACM addon. It is a day two companion for MCO and does not necessarily share any resources/configuration with the latter. It provides a unified installation approach of required dependencies (e.g. operator subscriptions) and resources (custom resources, certificates, CA Bundles, configuration) on the managed clusters to collect and forward logs
  > and traces. The addon's name is MultiCluster Observability Addon (MCOA).
